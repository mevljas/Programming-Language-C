# Tasks - 4th day
## Task 1:

Write a program (several functions) for generating the registration number, for checking the correctness of the registration number and for determining the registered components in the registration number.

 

## Task 2:

Generate and print of all 8 bit numbers that have exactly i bits lit. Finally, the program should also list how many such numbers there are and their sum. Read the value of the parameter i from the first argument of the program.

 

Example printout for i = 1

 ```
00000001 = 1

00000010 = 2

00000100 = 4

00001000 = 8

00010000 = 16

00100000 = 32

01000000 = 64

10000000 = 128

i = 1, n = 8, sum = 256

  ```

## Task 3:

Write a program that reads a file and counts the number of characters, lines and words in it (similar to how program **wc** works). Test the program carefully on different cases. In doing so, pay attention to double punctuation (e.g., two spaces), blank lines at the end of a file, and the like.
