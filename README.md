# The C Programming language
Faculty subject The C Programming language.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
1. Basic elements of C programming language
data types, variables constants;
expressions, operators and code structuring;
input/output, working with text and binary files;
dynamic memory allocation and strings;
multidimensional arrays;
function as a parameter and callbacks;
pointers and direct memory access; data structures
based on linked lists
headers and custom libraries
preprocessor, conditional compile and macros
2. Programming in the C language
presentation of good practices and pitfalls of
programming;
presentation of useful programming “recipes”;
testing and debugging C programming code of a big
project (gcc)
## Objectives and competences
The aim of this course is to present in detail the
programming language C and its integration into
virtually all areas of computing. In addition to the
concepts related to specific programming elements
(data types, variables, expressions, operators,
structures, functions, files, memory access, pointers, ...),
students will learn programming techniques used in
practice and ways of solving problems. In addition, they
will learn about the impact of the low-level
programming language and its ability to access to the
system and all system resources. They will learn how to
make larger programs using their own source code
combined with external code and libraries of other
authors.
Each student that will pass the exam will be able to
independently solve complex programming problems,
having a good insight into the computer programs on
the lowest level. Student will be able to understand and
fix the code of other programmers.
## Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding
Basic building blocks of the C programming languages:
data type, variable, constant expression, operator,
function, pointer, memory, arrays, files, ….
Understanding the general concepts of programming in
the low-level language. Comprehension of running the
compute programs at the operating system level and
the importance of the C language for its operation.
### Application
This course covers one of the basic computer skills. Due
to its design as well as for historical reasons, the C
programming language is very important building block
of almost every computer system. It is used in many
programs and operating systems. Knowing the C
language helps us to understand how a computer
system works and at the same time allows us to write
quick programs with direct access to system resources.
Many companies have a large piece of code the is still
written in the C programming language and they require
programmers for maintenance and further
development. Programmers with knowledge of the C
programming language are one of the most desirable
employees.
### Reflection
Knowledge of basic programming languages helps in
understanding how the computer works . Programming
language C is a powerful tool for solving industrial
problems, and writing business applications. It is also
used in a hardware design process and for parallel
solving problems on GPU.
### Transferable skills
Good knowledge of programming skills are very
important for understanding how the computer system
works.
