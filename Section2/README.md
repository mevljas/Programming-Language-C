# Tasks - 2nd day
## Task 1. 
Write a game "Guess the number". The computer should invent a number between 1 and n, where n = 100 if the program is run without arguments, and n = atoi (args [1]) otherwise. The program should then allow the user to enter numbers until the user guesses the selected number. The program should display "TOO MUCH" each time a number is too big and "TOO LITTLE" otherwise. If the number is correct, the program should display the number of attempts.

 

## Task 2. 
Write a program that reads words from the keyboard, one by one. When it reads the word “EOF”, it displays all the words read so far in reverse order. Assume that there are no more than 100 words in total; if there are any, at 100 stop reading and write out these 100 words read (ignore the rest).

## Task 3. 
Write a program that lists all the given arguments in random order.

## Task 4. 
Write a program to convert from seconds to HH: MM: SS format. Example: When a call is made, conversion 1005 the program should display:  

1005s = 00:16:45
